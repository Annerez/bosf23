# Say something!

I'm Karn, known by many people as a DevSecMLFinDataOps. I like all things servers related, especially on reproducible setups and high-availability deployment. I love providing solutions that actually solve problems, there's something very satisfying about uncovering the real pain points, in which users didn't even know it's there. 

If I have to tell one thing, it would be "just because it works doesn't mean you should do it."
