Hi my name is P'Moo (this is my actual nickname). I have completed Bangkok Open Source Festival 2023. During Hacktoberfest2023, i actively joined the event by contributing to many projects this year such as Huggingface, PyThaiNLP, Creatorgartens, etc 🔥. Moreover, i've got a tree-planted from Hacktoberfest as the first 50k contributors who made their PR/MR accepted! 🌳 🏆
